# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please email `f@faisalman.com` with a description of the issue, reproducible steps to get the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a new security advisory draft in our GitHub's Security Advisory page [https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js/security/advisories](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js/security/advisories) and acknowledge your contributions as part of it. This project follows a 90 days disclosure timeline.
