## Introduction

Welcome to the UAParser.js community! We're here to collaborate on developing an awesome project. Here are some general guidelines to make our community a great place:

### 1. Be Kind, Honest, and Respectful

Always treat others with kindness and respect. We value different opinions and encourage positive communication.

Please keep discussions related to the project. If you want to talk about something else, find the right place for it.

Feel free to ask for help, show gratitude for contributions, and make sure to give credit where it's due.

### 4. Resolving Disagreements

In the event of a disagreement, we encourage open and respectful dialogue. It's important to remember that it's okay to have differing opinions, and if a common ground can't be reached, we suggest using the 'agree to disagree' approach.
